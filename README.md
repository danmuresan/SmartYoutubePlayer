Online Smart YouTube Track Player and Mixer
##########################################################

Actually, after further reading, it seems YouTube does not allow separating audio from vide content by any means (via its API),
although there exist some online music streaming services which apparently do this (are allowed ?!)

The application, for its begenning, is supposed to be able to stream music. It should be designed Grooveshark style 
(as little refresh as possible, a lot of JavaScript)

MVC 4 based app, uses SoundManager2 JavaScript lib for music streaming helpers.

Lots of things to be done for this to become usable
